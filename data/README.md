# Datasets

The currently chosen dataset is Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis (
[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews) ).  
The dataset however has some unnecessary data and unicode characters, for this reason it is filtered using ```process_amazon.py```

Usage
```
python process_amazon.py test.ft.txt
python process_amaton.py train.ft.txt
```
